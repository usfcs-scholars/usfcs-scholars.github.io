{% include anchor.html h="h2" text="Scholarships" %}

Each scholar will receive **$8,125 per year** for 4 years.

The scholarships will be distributed through our [Office of Financial Aid](https://myusf.usfca.edu/financial-aid) as [refundable scholarships](https://myusf.usfca.edu/financial-aid/policies); after funds are applied to scholars' expenses any remaining funds may be disbursed to the scholar.

To be eligible for continued support, scholars must remain enrolled full-time in the Computer Science major, achieve both major and overall GPAs above 3.0, continue to qualify as low income, and participate in all required program activities. All activities listed on this page are required *except* the cohort enrollment, which is not required but strongly encouraged.

Scholars that fail to meet the funding requirements for a semester will be placed on probation. Scholars that fail to meet the requirements for two consecutive semesters will not be eligible to renew the scholarship.

{% include anchor.html h="h4" text="Other Funding" %}

In addition to the scholarships, the {% include ces.html %} program also funds up to $1,000 per scholar to support travel to conferences such as [Grace Hopper](https://ghc.anitab.org/) and [Tapia](http://tapiaconference.org/).
The program also funds the scholars' participation in the [head start](#summer-head-start) program.
This includes one week of on-campus housing and a meal plan, as well as any field trip costs.

<article class="message is-primary is-small">
  <div class="message-body">
    The CS Department and College of Arts and Sciences also provides additional funding opportunities for students to attend conferences. Scholars may apply for these opportunities to support additional travel.
  </div>
</article>

{% include anchor.html h="h2" text="Activities" %}

Scholars are expected to participate in the following activities. All of the activities are required, except for cohort enrollment which is strongly encouraged.

{% include anchor.html h="h4" text="Summer Head Start" %}

<p>
  {{ site.data.blurbs.headstart }}
</p>

The scholarship program covers the one week of additional housing costs and meal plan associated with the early arrival.

<article class="message is-primary is-small">
  <div class="message-body">
    Scholars that are also part of another early arrival residential program like the <a href="https://myusf.usfca.edu/student-life/casa/muscat">Muscat Scholars</a> or <a href="https://www.usfca.edu/academics/special-programs/black-achievement-success-engagement">BASE</a> will be able to still participate in those programs.
  </div>
</article>

{% include anchor.html h="h4" text="Cohort Enrollment" %}

The scholars will be **strongly encouraged** to enroll in the same sections of the [required CS major courses](https://www.usfca.edu/catalog/undergraduate/arts-sciences/computer-science/major) taken during the first and second years. This usually includes the following CS courses:

  - [CS 110 Introduction to Computer Science I](https://www.usfca.edu/catalog/course/110-introduction-computer-science-i)
  - [CS 112 Introduction to Computer Science II](https://www.usfca.edu/catalog/course/112-introduction-computer-science-ii)
  - [CS 220 Introduction to Parallel Computing](https://www.usfca.edu/catalog/course/220-introduction-parallel-computing) *or* [CS 221 C and Systems Programming](https://www.usfca.edu/catalog/course/221-c-and-systems-programming)
  - [CS 245 Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.usfca.edu/catalog/course/245-data-struct-algorithms)
  - [CS 212 Software Development](https://www.usfca.edu/catalog/course/212-software-development)

And this usually includes the following Math courses required for the CS major:

  - [Math 109 Calculus and Analytic Geometry I](https://www.usfca.edu/catalog/course/109-calculus-and-analytic-geometry-i)
  - [Math 201 Discrete Mathematics](https://www.usfca.edu/catalog/course/201-discrete-mathematics)
  - [Math 202 Linear Algebra & Probability](https://www.usfca.edu/catalog/course/202-linear-algebra-probability)

Scholars will *not* be required to enroll in courses they already received credit for via transfer credit or AP tests.

{% include anchor.html h="h4" text="Faculty Mentoring" %}

Scholars will have a dedicated faculty mentor from the [core team]({{ "/about.html#team" | relative_url }}). Scholars will initially meet their mentors during [CS 101](#cs-101) in the first semester, and once per semester after that (either in person or virtually).

<article class="message is-primary is-small">
  <div class="message-body">
    All CS majors are automatically assigned an academic advisor from the department. Scholars may request their dedicated faculty mentor also serves as their academic advisor.
  </div>
</article>

{% include anchor.html h="h4" text="Alumni Mentoring" %}

In addition to a faculty mentor, each scholar will also be paired with an <strong>alumnus mentor</strong> in their junior year. These alumni mentors will offer the scholars advice on preparing for a career in technology. Scholars will first meet their mentors at an in-person networking event during [CS 301](#cs-301) and will meet with their mentors twice monthly during the junior year (in person or virtually).

<article class="message is-primary is-small">
  <div class="message-body">
    There is also a university-wide <a href="https://www.usfca.edu/alumni/mentor">alumni mentor program</a> that is open to all students. Scholars may choose to participate in both programs if they wish.
  </div>
</article>

{% include anchor.html h="h2" text="Coursework" %}

Scholars are also expected to enroll in the following coursework. These courses count towards the general graduation requirements for scholars.

Specifically, all students must complete a [minimum of 128 credit hours](https://www.usfca.edu/catalog/regulations/student) to graduate. Of these, 44 credits make up the [core curriculum](https://www.usfca.edu/academics/undergraduate/core-curriculum) for all undergraduates regardless of major. The [CS major](https://www.usfca.edu/catalog/undergraduate/arts-sciences/computer-science/major) is another 52 credits. These courses count towards the remaining 32 additional credits that students must take to graduate.

Scholars will be given registration priority for these courses. A small number of other CS majors will also be able to enroll in these courses.
