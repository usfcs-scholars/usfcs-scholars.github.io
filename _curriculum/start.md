  - **[Computer and Information Technology Occupations](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/home.htm):** This is a web resource given to students on different occupations within the "Computer and Information Technology" area and their median pay.

  - **[Career One Stop](https://www.careeronestop.org/):** This is a web resource given to students that has salary ranges for different regions, including the SF Bay area.

Below are the materials from the "**Using Unix**" session. Some of the material is specific to the SF Bay area:

  - **[Using Unix Topic Sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u6U_Wakfgt0p1ijvee_E192AdzRJYs5uKkuZQWwL1VE/edit?usp=sharing)**: This document lists some of the topics (or specific Unix commands) to cover during the session.

Students were asked to use what they learned about Unix commands to discover a hidden poem on our CS lab computers. There was an issue with the clue that caused some issues with the exercise.

  - **[Python Programming Plan](/files/start2019/python-plan.pdf)**: This is the loose plan used to run the Python Programming sessions. The actual exercises were adjusted individually for students based on their backgrounds.

Below are the materials from the "CS Unplugged" session. We did not create these materials; they are from the "[CS Unplugged](https://www.csunplugged.org/en/)" website:

  - **[Parity Magic](https://www.csunplugged.org/en/topics/error-detection-and-correction/unit-plan/parity-magic/)**: This links to the CS Unplugged materials on the "Parity Magic" unit plan.

  - **[Parity Magic Interactive](https://csfieldguide.org.nz/en/interactives/parity/)**: This links to an interactive version of the "Parity Magic" unit plan that was used in class.

Below are the materials from the "**Faculty Scavenger Hunt**" session. This session was held on the same day as the college-wide start-of-semester meeting, which all faculty are expected to attend. This meant most faculty were on campus and able to participate in the scavenger hunt:

  - **[Faculty Scavenger Hunt Instructions](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTsoKCPWNuqEepmeY7KvwPtHacFpAMZgjCRtL5KR7PPoJzlSbSIOTLJH_iLfQRSMSC4LLMy6BOb5vna/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000):** These are the slides with the student instructions for the faculty scavenger hunt.

  - **[Faculty Scavenger Hunt](/files/start2019/Faculty Scavenger Hunt Template.docx)**: This is a Word document using an Avery template for business cards. On the first set of cards is the name of a professor, the desired way students should refer to that professor (e.g. by first name "Sophie" or by title "Professor Engle"), office location, and space for the student to fill in information. On the second set of cards is a blank space to fill in the name of a professor, followed by a short "tidbit" specific to a professor. An example tidbit might be "has a stuffed corgi plush in the office" or "once was a professional musician".

      Cards were then printed and students were randomly assigned into groups. Each group received a full set of faculty cards and a full set of tidbit cards. Both sets of cards were shuffled first. Students were then instructed to find a professor in their office. During their visit, students had to introduce themselves and provide each faculty member a tidbit about themselves. Then the students had to ask why that professor chose USF and write that reason on the front of the faculty card. They had to guess which tidbit card belong to that professor, and get one additional tidbit from that professor to write on the back of the faculty card.

      Afterwards, students all met again in the same room and shared what they learned about the faculty that participated in the scavenger hunt. There were no explicit prizes for being the first group to return.  

Below are the materials from the **ice breaker** sessions:

  - **[Shared Interest Ice Breaker](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQENh5CqWbLCw6D6_AsdhAkj4LZ3tALlQ8L3OXlEie3gD7PmlvnhO9RQ5NHxBbRlwMK3kZGM3Lmet7D/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000&slide=id.g5e1d929e1d_0_454):** Students drew a card to determine their group. Each group was instructed to find all of the shared interests within that group (such as movies, video games, sports, books, music, food, hobbies) and write those interests on the whiteboard. After 10 minutes, students returned to their seats and as a class we found any interests that were shared across all of the groups. The student instructions

  - **[Two Truths One Lie Ice Breaker](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQRcPSI7A0tlEuNTnF8rY-ZRtMfXsm0pk6YMwAiDopsonp6UnI0LcYOCdu2kjgGrGO1sQ9GLkDuV2wZ/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000&slide=id.g5f695c332d_0_206):** Students drew a card to determine their group. Each student had to think of two truths and one lie about themselves, and go around their group guessing which was the lie. Afterwards, some students volunteered to share their two truths and a lie with the entire class.

  - **[Advisor Ice Breaker Cards Template](/files/start2019/Ice Breaker Cards Template.docx), [Instructions](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRRRqeERadyKsYQQtHTwCKC0YyCjRfG41AX7bKB_ol4UeicvPoNBro_ElydQk7Mof-Yc1hUSgNdAyp-/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000&slide=id.g5f6b85df88_0_194):** This is a Word document using an Avery template for business cards. On each business card is a name of a student's academic success coach or CS major advisor. Cards were printed out and then randomly distributed to each student. Students had to swap cards with each other until they had cards for their own academic success coach and CS advisor.

Various other website resources were given to students, which can be found on the detailed [daily schedule](/start2019/schedule.html) on the Fall 2019 CS head start website.

Not included are materials provided in the workshops led by on-campus offices such as our [Learning Center](https://myusf.usfca.edu/learning-center) and [Health Promotion Services](https://myusf.usfca.edu/hps). These are materials we did not create ourselves for this program.
