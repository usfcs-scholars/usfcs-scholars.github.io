<h6 class="subtitle has-text-grey is-italic has-text-weight-light"><a href="https://map.concept3d.com/?id=924#!m/160032">University Center</a> (UC), 5th Floor, OneCard Office<br/>

Plan to move in between from 8:30am to 12:00pm. The [Outside Lands](https://www.sfoutsidelands.com/) music festival is taking place in nearby [Golden Gate Park](https://sfrecpark.org/parks-open-spaces/golden-gate-park-guide/), so expect heavy traffic.

The [OneCard](https://myusf.usfca.edu/one-card) office is closed on Sunday, so you cannot pick up your official student ID card. Instead, go straight to your residence hall front desk and pick up a temporary ID card for access.

If you [uploaded a photo](https://myusf.usfca.edu/one-card/upload-your-photo) for your OneCard (student ID card), we will have your official student ID card for you on the first day of the head start program on Monday, August 12th. You can use this card to [access buildings](https://myusf.usfca.edu/one-card/card-access) on campus, as well as your [flexi meal plan](https://myusf.usfca.edu/one-card/flexi-meal-plan) and [Dons Dollars](https://myusf.usfca.edu/one-card/don-dollars).

You and your families are invited to a special campus tour with Ambassador D'Andre Carson, organized just for you! Even if you attended a tour before, this tour will help orient you on campus now that you are moved in and ready to start classes.

The tour will start in the same location as the welcome lunch, and end at the location for the following orientation.
