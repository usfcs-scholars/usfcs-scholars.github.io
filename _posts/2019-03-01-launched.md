We are delighted to announce that the **Community Engaged Scholars in Computer Science** scholarship program at the University of San Francisco is now officially funded by the [NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Program  (S-STEM)](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5257) under [Grant No. 1833718](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1833718). The program will start funding scholars *this* Fall 2019!

This initiative was started by [Professor Sami Rollins](http://srollins.cs.usfca.edu/) before she joined NSF as a Program Director in the [Division of Undergraduate Education](https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=DUE). See the [About](/about.html) section for the entire team that made this happen!
