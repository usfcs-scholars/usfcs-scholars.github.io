- q: 'Do I have to participate in all of the activities?'
  a: |
    Yes, but individual absences can be excused or made up depending on the circumstances.</p>

    <p>For example, scholars must enroll in CS 301 (career prep). However, if a scholar is unable to make a field trip associated with the course, it may be possible participate in an alternative event instead.

- q: 'Why do I have to participate in all of the activities to receive the scholarship funding?'
  a: |
    The goal of this program is to improve outcomes for low-income students. These activities are based on existing literature showing they help improve these outcomes (such as year-to-year retention or graduation rates). The scholarship funding is to support participation in this activities. Specifically, the funding is designed to offset the need to work on campus during the academic year and make it easier for students to participate in these activities.

- q: 'Do I have to enroll in the same courses as other scholars?'
  a: |
    Cohort enrollment (which involves all scholars enrolling in the same courses) is <strong>strongly</strong> encouraged for all lower division (100 or 200-level courses) but not required. If one of the cohort course sections conflicts with your schedule, you may select an alternative.</p>

    <p>Scholars also do not have to enroll for a course they already received credit for. For example, if you received credit for <a href="https://www.usfca.edu/catalog/course/109-calculus-and-analytic-geometry-i">Math 109 Calculus and Analytic Geometry I</a> then you do not need to enroll in that course with the other scholars.

- q: 'What happens if I switch majors?'
  a: 'You must be a CS major to continue receiving funding. You should speak with an advisor before switching majors.'

- q: 'What happens if I do not graduate in 4 years?'
  a: 'You will no longer receive scholarship funding past the fourth year. However, scholars will still have access to their faculty advisor and may apply for other funding opportunities.'

- q: 'What if I do not plan to live on campus for the first year? Do I still need to participate in the head start program?'
  a: 'Yes, even if you are not living on campus, you will need to still participate in the activities during that week.'

- q: 'Am I still eligible for other department scholarships?'
  a: "Yes, participation in this program does not exclude you from other scholarship opportunities. We announce scholarship opportunities via our students' mailing list, which you are added to automatically after taking your first CS course."

- q: 'Am I still eligible for on-campus work?'
  a: 'Yes, participation in this program does not affect your eligibility for on campus work (although we hope the scholarships lessens the need for it). Visit our <a href="https://myusf.usfca.edu/student-employment/students">student employment office website</a> for details.'
